Their paper aims to explore why we find large, overparameterized networks easier to train than the smaller networks we can find by pruning or distilling.

- [morph net](https://github.com/winnerineast/morph-net):MorphNet is a method for learning deep network structure during training.

When the regularizer loss is added to the training loss and their sum is minimized via stochastic gradient descent or a similar optimizer, the learning problem becomes a constrained optimization of the structure of the network, under the constraint represented by the regularizer. The method was first introduced in our CVPR 2018, paper "MorphNet: Fast & Simple Resource-Constrained Learning of Deep Network Structure". A overview of the approach as well as new device-specific latency regularizers were prestend in GTC 2019.

- [ORB-SLAM2](https://github.com/winnerineast/ORB_SLAM2): ORB-SLAM2 is a real-time SLAM library for Monocular, Stereo and RGB-D cameras that computes the camera trajectory and a sparse 3D reconstruction (in the stereo and RGB-D case with true scale). 

## <a name="GAN">GAN</a>
- [Deep Privacy](https://github.com/winnerineast/DeepPrivacy):DeepPrivacy is a fully automatic anonymization technique for images.
- [Image Generator](https://github.com/winnerineast/image_generator):using GANs to generate images.
- [Keras GAN](https://github.com/winnerineast/Keras-GAN-1):Collection of Keras implementations of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) suggested in research papers. These models are in some cases simplified versions of the ones ultimately described in the papers, but I have chosen to focus on getting the core ideas covered instead of getting every layer configuration right. Contributions and suggestions of GAN varieties to implement are very welcomed.
- [PyTorch GAN](https://github.com/winnerineast/PyTorch-GAN):Collection of PyTorch implementations of Generative Adversarial Network varieties presented in research papers. Model architectures will not always mirror the ones proposed in the papers, but I have chosen to focus on getting the core ideas covered instead of getting every layer configuration right. Contributions and suggestions of GANs to implement are very welcomed.
- [Torch Gan](https://github.com/winnerineast/torchgan):TorchGAN is a Pytorch based framework for designing and developing Generative Adversarial Networks. This framework has been designed to provide building blocks for popular GANs and also to allow customization for cutting edge research. Using TorchGAN's modular structure allows:Trying out popular GAN models on your dataset;Plug in your new Loss Function, new Architecture, etc. with the traditional ones;Seamlessly visualize the training with a variety of logging backends.

- [TRFL](https://github.com/winnerineast/trfl): TRFL (pronounced "truffle") is a library built on top of TensorFlow that exposes several useful building blocks for implementing Reinforcement Learning agents.
- [Weight Agnostic Neural Networks](https://github.com/winnerineast/weightagnostic.github.io): Not all neural network architectures are created equal, some perform much better than others for certain tasks. But how important are the weight parameters of a neural network compared to its architecture? In this work, we question to what extent neural network architectures alone, without learning any weight parameters, can encode solutions for a given task. We propose a search method for neural network architectures that can already perform a task without any explicit weight training. To evaluate these networks, we populate the connections with a single shared weight parameter sampled from a uniform random distribution, and measure the expected performance. We demonstrate that our method can find minimal neural network architectures that can perform several reinforcement learning tasks without weight training. On supervised learning domain, we find architectures that can achieve much higher than chance accuracy on MNIST using random weights.
